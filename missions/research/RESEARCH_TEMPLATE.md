# Research Mission [R#.#]: [Research Topic]

## Mission Metadata
- **Session Type**: Research
- **Estimated Tokens**: [5k-25k recommended per session]
- **AI System**: [Claude/GPT-4/Gemini/Other]
- **Parallel Tracks**: [List other missions running in parallel]
- **Dependencies**: [Previous missions this builds on]

## Available Tools
- vsc-mcp: For symbol-level code editing (edit_symbol, read_symbol)
- sequential-thinking: For complex planning
- context7: For library docs

## Research Objectives
Define 3-5 specific questions that fit within a single session:
1. [Quantitative question - seeking metrics, benchmarks, algorithms]
2. [Qualitative question - seeking patterns, approaches, best practices]
3. [Feasibility question - seeking limitations, gotchas, edge cases]
4. [Market question - seeking adoption patterns, user feedback, alternatives]
5. [Technical depth question - seeking implementation details]

## Token Budget Allocation
- Initial prompt with context: ~2k tokens
- Research queries: ~3k tokens
- Response space: ~15-20k tokens
- Follow-up refinements: ~5k tokens

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Specific algorithms/techniques identified with performance metrics
- [ ] Implementation patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Adoption barriers quantified with data
- [ ] Edge cases and limitations catalogued
- [ ] Actionable insights for build missions extracted
