# S21.SP1 Follow-Up Tickets

Generated from Registration Optimistic Lock Spike (S21.SP1-20251024)

---

## Completed (24 Oct 2025)

- **TICKET-01** – Already-applied detection implemented in `registration-pipeline.js` & `optimistic-lock.js`, ensuring duplicate `submitForReview()` calls resolve without additional writes.
- **TICKET-02** – Extended `tests/registration/concurrency.test.js` with idempotency coverage; guardrail run passes post-fix.
- **TICKET-03** – Wired optimistic-lock retry metrics, structured logging, and event emissions (`registration-pipeline.js`, `optimistic-lock.js`); metrics exposed via `RegistrationPipeline#getMetrics()` and covered by tests.
