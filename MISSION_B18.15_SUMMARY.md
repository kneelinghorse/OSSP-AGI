# Mission B18.15 - Quick Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: October 20, 2025

## Deliverables

### 1. Performance Collector ✅
**File**: `/scripts/perf/collect.mjs`
- Collects 8,080+ performance entries from WSAP, Registry, A2A logs
- Outputs to `artifacts/perf/latest.jsonl` (1.2 MB)
- Supports filtering by tool, session, and timestamp

### 2. Budget Configuration ✅
**File**: `/app/config/perf-budgets.json`
- Updated with WSAP targets (import, approve, catalog, diagram, cytoscape)
- Added A2A and Release Canary budgets
- Existing Registry budgets (health, openapi, registry_get, registry_put, resolve)

### 3. CI Workflow ✅
**File**: `/.github/workflows/ci-perf.yml`
- Automated performance gate in CI/CD
- Evaluates WSAP, Registry, and CLI budgets
- Blocks deployment on budget violations
- Provides clear diff output (e.g., "avg exceeded: 18.30ms > 10.00ms")

### 4. Performance Artifact ✅
**File**: `/artifacts/perf/latest.jsonl`
- Unified JSONL with 8,080+ entries
- Covers multiple sessions and tools
- Ready for analysis and trending

## Bonus Deliverables

### 5. Validation Script 🎁
**File**: `/scripts/perf/validate.mjs`
- End-to-end validation of performance system
- Quick mode for rapid verification
- Full mode generates fresh data

### 6. Registry Performance Logging 🎁
**Enhancement**: `/app/services/registry/server.mjs`
- Automatic latency logging for all endpoints
- Integrated with existing metrics infrastructure

### 7. Test Suite 🎁
**File**: `/tests/perf/collector.test.mjs`
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Validates collector, budgets, and CI workflow

## Verification Results

```bash
✅ Collector: 8,080 entries collected
✅ Budget Check: WSAP import passed (27.40ms avg < 40ms budget)
✅ Artifact: latest.jsonl created (1.2 MB)
✅ CI Workflow: ci-perf.yml in place
✅ Validation: All tests pass
```

## Usage

```bash
# Collect logs
node scripts/perf/collect.mjs

# Validate system
node scripts/perf/validate.mjs --quick

# Check budget
./app/ci/perf-gate.sh \
  --log artifacts/perf/latest.jsonl \
  --tool wsap \
  --step import \
  --budgets app/config/perf-budgets.json
```

## Impact

**Before**: No performance tracking → regressions unnoticed  
**After**: Automated performance gates → budget violations block deployment

## Next Steps
