# Scaffold Smoke Artifacts

Sprint 21 removed the generated smoke scaffolds that were filled with TODO
placeholders. The legacy output now lives under
`artifacts/archive/scaffold-smoke-legacy/` for historical reference.

This directory stays empty until we have vetted, working samples to publish.
See `docs/SPRINT_21_SURFACE_CHANGES.md#scaffold-artifacts` for the status of
replacement examples and pointers to the maintained samples in
`artifacts/examples/`.
