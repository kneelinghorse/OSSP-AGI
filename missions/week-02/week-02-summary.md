## Mission Overview â€“ B3.1 Web Viewer Foundation
Build an Express server to serve protocol manifests and a React viewer to visualize protocol panels, dogfooding the Semantic Protocol for describing the viewer itself.

### Why This Matters
- Makes protocol data accessible through web interface
- Demonstrates Semantic Protocol usage (dogfooding)
- Enables interactive exploration of protocol relationships
- Provides foundation for Week 3 deliverables

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Seed Curator API
- [ ] Design seed manifest structure and curator API
- [ ] Implement seed loader with bundled override resolution
- [ ] Build seed validator for manifest completeness
- [ ] Create seed registry for available demonstrations

### Phase 2: Pre-Configured Seeds
- [ ] Stripe OpenAPI seed with 12 override rules
- [ ] GitHub OpenAPI seed with 8 override rules
- [ ] Petstore OpenAPI seed as baseline example
- [ ] Bundle manifests with metadata and documentation

### Phase 3: Docker Database Seeds
- [ ] Northwind PostgreSQL Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Sakila PostgreSQL Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Seed data loading scripts
- [ ] Connection configuration templates

### Phase 4: CLI Demo Command
- [ ] Implement `proto demo` command
- [ ] Support demo selection (stripe, github, petstore, northwind, sakila)
- [ ] Auto-import with bundled overrides
- [ ] Generate governance report after demo
- [ ] Interactive demo mode with guided steps

### Testing & Integration
- [ ] Unit tests for seed curator
- [ ] Integration tests with Docker containers
- [ ] E2E test: demo â†’ import â†’ review â†’ governance
- [ ] Validate seed manifests
- [ ] Performance: demo setup <30s

## Key Design Decisions

### Seed Directory Structure
```
app/seeds/
â”œâ”€â”€ curator.js              # Seed loading and management
â”œâ”€â”€ registry.js             # Available seed catalog
â”œâ”€â”€ openapi/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stripe/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json   # Seed metadata
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spec.json       # OpenAPI spec
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ overrides/      # Bundled override rules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ github/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spec.json
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ overrides/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ petstore/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ spec.json
â””â”€â”€ databases/
    â”œâ”€â”€ northwind/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ seed.sql
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ sakila/
        â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
        â”œâ”€â”€ seed.sql
        â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Seed Manifest Format
```json
{
  "id": "stripe-api",
  "type": "openapi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Stripe API Seed",
  "description": "Stripe API with customer and payment endpoints",
  "spec_path": "./spec.json",
  "overrides_path": "./overrides",
  "tags": ["payment", "api", "stripe"],
  "metadata": {
    "protocol_count": 50,
    "pii_fields": 15,
    "override_rules": 12,
    "api_endpoints": 25
  }
}
```

### Demo Command API
```bash
# List available demos
proto demo list

# Run specific demo
proto demo run stripe

# Run with governance report
proto demo run github --with-governance

# Interactive guided demo
proto demo interactive

# Start database seed
proto demo db northwind --start
proto demo db northwind --stop
```

---

## Integration Points

### With Importers
- Pre-configured Stripe/GitHub specs load via OpenAPI importer
- Docker databases connect via Postgres importer
- Bundled overrides auto-load from seed paths
- Manifests include import configuration

### With Override Engine
- Seed-specific override rules in `seed/*/overrides/`
- Override engine recognizes seed source type
- Rule precedence: seed < community < org < project
- Seed packs validate during curator load

### With Governance Generator
- Demo command can trigger governance generation
- Seed manifests provide protocol statistics
- Demo mode includes governance review step
- Generated GOVERNANCE.md includes seed metadata

---

## Expected Outputs

### Curator API
```javascript
const { SeedCurator } = require('./seeds/curator');

const curator = new SeedCurator();

// List available seeds
const seeds = curator.listSeeds();
// [{ id: 'stripe-api', type: 'openapi', ... }]

// Load seed
const seed = await curator.loadSeed('stripe-api');
// { manifest, spec, overrides }

// Import seed
const result = await curator.importSeed('stripe-api', {
  workspace: './demo-workspace',
  includeOverrides: true
});
```

### CLI Command Output
```bash
$ proto demo run stripe

ðŸŽ¯ Running Stripe API Demo...

ðŸ“¥ Loading seed: stripe-api
   âœ“ Manifest validated
   âœ“ Spec loaded (127 KB)
   âœ“ 12 override rules loaded

ðŸ”„ Importing protocols...

  3. Explore graph: proto graph visualize
```
